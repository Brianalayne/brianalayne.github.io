						<div class="content">
							<p align="left">For five years, I have worked at <a href="https://bellmontpartners.com/"> Bellmont Partners </a> (BP), an Edina-based public relations agency. Helping nonprofits reach goals through communication strategies & tactics is both a personal & agency-wide passion.</p>

							<p align="left">Not only do we have a <a href="https://bellmontpartners.com/nonprofit-public-relations/"> nonprofit practice group </a> made up of talented communicators who have worked at nonprofits &/or serve(d) on boards, we also have a program called Bellmont Gives Back, which allows BP employees to use work-day hours to volunteer for organizations & causes we are passionate about.</p>

							<p align="left">My capstone project marries three of my favorite things: nonprofits, communications & graphic design. I first named & branded the program & strategized to develop a “curriculum” for what the manifestation of the project will look like physically & digitally.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p align="left">Since our agency has worked with dozens of nonprofit organizations, we have a plethora of combined anecdotal research about the reasons nonprofits struggle to pull off successful communications & marketing campaigns. Nine times out of 10, it boils down to strains on: <b>time, money & staff</b>. </p>

							<p align="left">Knowing this, we wanted to secure some actual data from nonprofits across the state. So, I reached out to the <a href="https://www.minnesotanonprofits.org/"> Minnesota Council of Nonprofits </a> to see if we could tap into their network to distribute a survey that a team of my colleagues helped brainstorm questions for. <i>(Long story short: timing for this ended up being a significant challenge. More on that later.)</i> </p>

							<p align="left">Besides getting data from nonprofits, I knew I wanted to brand Bellmont Gives Back, so I simultaneously worked on visual research for that. I looked into several employee give-back programs to see how they were branded against the larger company brands. Knowing that I wanted BP's core blue & orange colors to be the anchor for Bellmot Gives Back, I also sourced visuals using that color palette that I really liked. I developed a moodboard to inspire the direction for Bellmont Gives Back's visual identity:</p>

							<p align="left">The color palette is a play on the primary colors. That, along with the hand-drawn elements, further supports the fact that Bellmont Gives Back is about providing nonprofits with fundamental resources to help them communicate more strongly & effectively with their stakeholders.</p>

							<p align="left">The brand is approachable & playful, yet professional; visually conveying the duality of how Bellmont Partners approaches our work with clients - especially nonprofits. It ladders up well to the Bellmont Partners logo, yet still has its own unique identity.</p>

									<p align="left">Because it has been very challenging to connect with the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, as an agency, we decided to host an event on Give to the Max Day (Thursday, Nov. 14) to let anyone in the nonprofit space have a place to strategize, network, connect & celebrate on Minnesota's big giving holiday.</p>

									<p align="left">While we haven't had a chance to survey Minnesota nonprofits yet (I'm still  meeting with someone on Monday, Nov. 4 to see if that will be a possibility in the near future!), we're using it as a soft launch for Bellmont Gives Back & hope to pick the brains of the nonprofit contacts who are planning to attend about the kinds of resources they'd like to see come from Bellmont Gives Back. So far, we have 20+ attendees registered on our <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bellmont-partners-give-to-the-max-day-gathering-tickets-78662540777?aff=ebdssbeac">Eventbrite</a>.</p>

									<p align="left">We'll have a leave-behind telling attendees about Bellmont Gives Back & letting them know how they can help us shape the program.</p>
